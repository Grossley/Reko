# ProjectMSS
A Minecraft Server Status checker discord bot! Still in development not near finished I'll update this readme when the project is closer to being finished!
# Licence/Terms of use
I haven't setup a Licence yet but if you wish to fork the project and make our own version, please make sure to run it by me once (You can contact me on Discord, My Discord Server: https://discord.gg/8vNHAA36fR). This is to prevent people from copying the bot and posting it as their own. I do wish to publish this bot!

I'm not the best Python dev but I'm trying to improve and thats one of the reasons behind this project! This is just a chill fun project for me on the side. I've got a lot of things going on in my life currently so don't expect amazing support or anything I'm just a random guy on the internet making a discord bot for fun! 

Thanks for viewing the repo I will update the bot (and this readme) and make it better in the future!
