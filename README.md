## Website
Reko has a website now! Go check it out! [Link](https://reko.technotalks.net/)
## Setup
I request that you don't run a seperate instance of the bot and instead just [invite](https://reko.technotalks.net/) it. If your are testing or contributing to the bot then please go ahead!

If you try and run the code with exactly whats there now you will run into a couple errors!
1. Please create and .env file in the secrets folder with the value TOKEN. Please do not include quotes around the token of your bot.
```
TOKEN=A123C456B7890
```
2. Please replace the connection to the MongoDB database in dc.py to the connection to your database.

## Licence/Terms of use
I haven't setup a Licence yet but you are welcome to fork the project and play around with it! If you plan on publishing your forked version (with valid and extensive changes), please make sure to run it by me once (You can contact me through my [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8vNHAA36fR)). This is to prevent people from copying the bot and posting it as their own. To make it clear you can fork/clone this project to learn/play around with it but you **may not** publish this forked version of this bot unless approved by me!
I do wish to publish this bot in the future!
## Thanks
Thanks for viewing the repo I will update the bot (and this readme) and make it better in the future! 

PS: Go add the bot! Link on the [website](https://reko.technotalks.net/)!
